# ðŸ§  Math Memory Game

**Math Memory Game** is an educational card-matching game where players test their memory and math skills by pairing hidden cards with equivalent expressions or values. For example, a card showing `6 / 3` matches with `2`, and `4 * 2` matches with `8` . You have to match all cards in a specified time.

Itâ€™s perfect for learners who want to sharpen their mental math and memory at the same time.
